## Understanding the Socratic Method

The term "Socratic" is derived from the name of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. Socratic dialogue is a cooperative argumentative dialogue that aims to stimulate critical thinking and elicit ideas and underlying assumptions. It involves a series of questions and answers designed to examine complex issues from various perspectives. The goal is not to win an argument or establish a single "correct" answer, but to collaboratively explore the subject matter, challenge preconceptions, and enhance understanding.

### Harnessing Socratic Dialogue with AI

Socratic AI employs this powerful technique by engaging multiple AI agents in conversation with each other and the user, without the need for prompt engineering. The outcome is a more comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the issue, ultimately guiding users toward better-informed decisions and effective solutions.
